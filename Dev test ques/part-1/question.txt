Ques 2 . example of spooled device
The most common implementation of spooling can be found in typical input/output devices such as the keyboard, mouse and printer. 
For example, in printer spooling,
 the documents/files that are sent to the printer are first stored in the memory or printer spooler.

Ques 3. Which languages necessarily need heap allocation in the runtime environment? 
Explanation: Heap allocation is needed for dynamic data structures like tree, linked list, etc.

Ques 4. when are ll and arrays used
Both Arrays and Linked List can be used to store linear data of similar types, but they both have some advantages and disadvantages.
ArrayList provides constant time for search operation, so it is better to use ArrayList if searching is more frequent operation than add and remove operation.
 The LinkedList provides constant time for add and remove operations. So it is better to use LinkedList for manipulation

Ques 5. in the instruction add a b the answer gets stored in
Explanation: In any instruction of the form ADD A, B; the answer gets stored in the A register. The format is: ADD Destination, Source.

* brain of computer = central processing unit (cpu). It consists of a control unit and the arithmetic and logic unit. It is responsible for performing all the processes and operations.
* central nervous system of computer = control unit. because it selects and interprets the instructions and coordinates execution.
* Mbr = memory buffer register.
* Pc = program counter. The Program counter contains the address of the next instruction which is to be fetched by the control unit.
* The IR which stands for the instruction register contains the last instruction fetched.
* Sequencing is the process of causing the CPU to step through a series of micro operations. Execution causes the performance of each micro operation.
* Sequencing followed by the process of execution is performed by the Control signals. Sequencing is traversing each and every operation whereas execution causes the performance of each operation.
* What does D in the D-flip flop stand for? = delay ;In the hardwired control unit, the delay element method uses D-flip flop which causes a delay. Since, in the delay element method, there must be a finite time gap between the 2 steps.
